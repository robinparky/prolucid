#QCorr Paramters
InjWindow		4	#Isolation window size
MassAccuracy		0.1	#bin width for binning out spectra
Normalize		false	#normalizes mass spectra before cross correlation
FilterPeaks		false	#sorts peaks by intensity and only uses peaks with rank above PeakThreshold for correlation
PeakThreshold		200	#minimum rank of peak threshold

#Output
OutputFile	true	#creates precusors.txt file containing calculated weights and correlation scores 
OutputCCArray	false	#outputs CC array file
